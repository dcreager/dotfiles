# GitHub Codespaces dotfiles

This is not the repo where I actually keep my dotfiles!  For that, please check
out [dcreager/dotfiles-base](https://github.com/dcreager/dotfiles-base) and
[dcreager/dotfiles-public](https://github.com/dcreager/dotfiles-public).  This repo only contains
the necessary install script to set up my _real_ dotfiles inside of GitHub
Codespaces.
